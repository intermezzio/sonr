The highway is also equipped with a REST server.  The following is a diagram outlining the topology of highway and available features.\\n\\nWe believe the best way to onboard the next billion users is to create a cohesive end-to-end platform that\u2019s composable and interoperable with all existing protocols. For this, we built our Networking layer in Libp2p and our Layer 1 Blockchain with Starport. Our network comprises of two separate nodes: Highway and Motor, which each have a specific use case on the network. In order to maximize the onboarding experience, we developed our own Wallet which has value right out of the gate!\\n\\n\\n\x3c!-- \\n[t](\\"https://www.figma.com/file/kZVXK3yJOxmukNdckjh2RT/Highway-SDK?node-id=2%3A12\\") --\x3e\\n\\n\\n\\n# Using the CLI\\n\\nour Highway-sdk comes with a set of CLI commands&#x20;\\n\\n\\n\\n```none\\nserve - Serves our GRPC and HTTP servers on the specified ports in our enviorment files\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n# Using REST\\n\\nThe highway is capable of running an http server (REST) with \'serve\' ports can be specified\\n\\n*   Register\\n\\n*   Authentication\\n\\n*   Objects&#x20;\\n\\n    *   Create\\n\\n    *   Update\\n\\n    *   Deactivate\\n\\n*   Buckets\\n\\n    *   Create\\n\\n    *   Update\\n\\n    *   Deactivate\\n\\n*   Channels\\n\\n    *   Create\\n\\n    *   Hide\\n\\n*   registry\\n\\n    *   query\\n\\n    *   exists"}]}')}}]);
