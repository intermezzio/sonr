Imagine a world where you can sign up to get a driver's license for the internet. This driver's license would be encrypted on the Sonr network blockchain retaining a record book of all your devices and data quickly guaranteeing you universal validity. Only you will be able to access your record book with your driverâ€™s license.

When signing into a traditional application you have probably been asked to sign in with Google or Facebook. Your internet driverâ€™s license would be able to sign you in just as easily!

But beyond sign-in, your driverâ€™s license could directly contact every other driverâ€™s license on earth in real-time allowing you to exchange files, money, messages, contracts, and anything digital with other driverâ€™s licenses. Since your driverâ€™s license would be encrypted on a blockchain your exchanges will become quicker and more secure than typical cloud storage that is prone to hacks.

Soon you wonâ€™t even have to imagine it!ðŸš€
