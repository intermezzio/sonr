# Tokenomics

ðŸš§ Work in Progress

The Sonr team is currently working with [Prysm Group](https://www.prysmgroup.io/) to design a robust tokenomics model to foster and reward activity on the Sonr network. This model will include mechanisms around: 

1. Governance 
2. Staking 
3. Exchange
4. Swapping
5. Validator rewards 

Contact the Sonr team for more details on our tokenomics design.
