# Why Sonr?
Sonr's decentralized realtime network provides Web3 developers with a toolset that makes it possible to quickly deploy scalable Web3 applications with verifiable data that can be reused and shared across all Sonr powered applications.

### Developer Experience

We believe application development should be as straight forward as possible. Sonr's SDK's is an all-in-one solution for developing applications for the Sonr network. We believe in consistency and openness, our libraries are built on open standards.



### Verifiable Identity

Each domain registered is backed by a Decentralized Identifier (DID) which is unique on our network for your domain name.  This identifier is paired with a public key credential which creates your unique profile. Your \`did\` is written on our block chains ledger. This ledger is open to all and fully auditable.

### Composable by Design

Our protocols are flexible and are capable of wrapping custom protocols, These protocols are extendable, and support merging allowing for reusability and composability.
